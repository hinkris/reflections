What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When we initialize the git hidden files that contian the structure of the folder gets created so that 
things can be tracked. We need to do it so that git can be explicitely created i guess?

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The working directory is the place in the file system i think while the staging area exists only virtually until
the commit is done. The repository also exists in the git file probably but is the name of the entire thing and 
more permanent. 

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

when there's a change u can add it to the staging area and then
commit it if need be?

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

When you are making changes to earlier answers but also want the earlier answer intact then branches would help i think. 
Because making changes to earlier branches means that the program will go in a different direction entirely so we need
branches to keep all possible "routes" available.

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

If you want your repo to be accessible from anywhere. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

so we have control over when it happens. Sometimes the internet may not be connected so that will lead to errors? Not sure.
